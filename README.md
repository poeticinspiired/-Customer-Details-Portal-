Description
The Customer Details Portal is a Windows Form application developed using C# in the .NET Framework, designed to connect to an MS SQL Server database. This project demonstrates real-time data handling and UI management, allowing users to view detailed customer information from the NorthWind database. It was created as part of my coursework and achieved a perfect score of 100/100.![Screenshot 2024-04-29 163926](https://github.com/poeticinspiired/-Customer-Details-Portal-/assets/89709811/37f3bdfb-1332-4e39-b89a-007a7fed68d1)
